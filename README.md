# Module 3 Challenge: Random password generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project provided the HTML & CSS code, and basic JavaScript code. The goal was to create a random password generator in JavaScript that would generate a random password with the options: lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special symbols, and numeric characters between 8 and 128 characters long. 

I utilized mainly else if statements, for loops, and defined variables to make this happen. I also referenced several YouTube videos and had a tutoring session in order to troubleshoot my code. I learned a lot about how JavaScript calls functions and what it actually means to pull from an array. The troubleshooting phase helped me learn how to use console.log in order to validate my code. Going line by line also helped me use console to find exactly where any errors were which was very helpful.



## Usage

To use, click generate password, then follow the prompts. After the last prompt is answered, the generated password should appear in the text box. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
